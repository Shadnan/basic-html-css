    <h1>Practicing Basic HTML, CSS and GitHub</h1>
    <p>HTML and CSS are the basics of Web development. We can't think of a website without Html and Css. 
        We have to acquire the Basic knowledge of Html and Css. without practice we can't learn it properly.</p>

        <div class="basic">
            <h1>Here we are going to learn some html tags:</h1>
            <h3>There are total 6 heading in Html. h1 to h6</h3>
            <ul>
                <h4>These tag calls semantic tag. Because we can understand the function of these tags easily. Semantic HTML tags are tags that define the meaning of the content they contain.</h4>

                <li>This is <b>bold</b></li>
                <li>This is <strong>Strong</strong></li>
                <li>This is <i>italic</i></li>
                <li>This is <em>emphasize (em)</em></li>
                <li>This is <small>small</small></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="basic2">
           <div class="right">
            <h1>What is inline elements?</h1>
           <P>Inline elements display in a line. They do not force the text after them to a new line. An anchor (or link) is an example of an inline element. Above tags are also inline elements</P>
           </div>
        </div>

        <div class="basic3">
            <h1>What is block elements</h1>
            
            <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). Two commonly used block elements are "P" tag and "div" tag.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="basic4">
            <h1>What is lnline-block?</h1>
            <p>Inline-Block Elements: These elements are displayed as inline elements, meaning they do not start on a new line, but they can have set widths and heights like block elements. This allows them to flow within text or other inline elements while also having block-level properties.

                Using the display: inline-block property allows elements to behave like inline elements in terms of their placement within text or other inline elements while still allowing for the application of properties like width, height, margins, and padding as you would with block-level elements.
                
                For example, you might use inline-block for creating navigation menus where each menu item is a block with its own width and height but flows inline with other menu items.</p>
